A numerical model has been developed and tested that is capable of predicting the temperature rise due to a high amplitude ultrasound field. The acoustic field is modelled using a numerical solution to the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov (KZK) equation, known as the Bergen Code, which is implemented in cylindrical symmetric form. A finite difference representation of the thermal equations is used to calculate the resulting temperature rises. The model allows for the inclusion of a number of layers of tissue with different acoustic and thermal properties and accounts for the effects of non-linear propagation, direct heating by the transducer, thermal diffusion and perfusion in different tissues. The effect of temperature-dependent skin perfusion and variation in background temperature between the skin and deeper layers of the body are included. The model has been tested against analytic solutions for simple configurations and then used to estimate temperature rises in realistic obstetric situations. A pulsed 3 MHz transducer operating with an average acoustic power of 200 mW leads to a maximum steady state temperature rise inside the foetus of 1.25 degrees C compared with a 0.6 degree C rise for the same transmitted power under linear propagation conditions. The largest temperature rise occurs at the skin surface, with the temperature rise at the foetus limited to less than 2 degrees C for the range of conditions considered.\",\n          \"The objective of the present study was to assess changes in cellular energy metabolism in focal and perifocal areas of a stroke lesion and to explore how these changes are modulated by preischemic hyperglycemia. A model for reversible occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rats was used to study changes in energy metabolism. Following MCA occlusion for 5, 15, or 30 min in normoglycemic rats, the tissue was frozen in situ, and samples from the lateral caudoputamen and from two neocortical areas were collected for metabolite analyses, together with a control sample from the contralateral, nonischemic hemisphere. Two other groups, subjected to 30 min of MCA occlusion, were made hyperglycemic by acute glucose infusion or by prior injection of streptozotocin. Enzymatic techniques were used for measurements of phosphocreatine, creatine, ATP, ADP, AMP, glycogen, glucose, pyruvate, and lactate. The neocortex of the contralateral, nonischemic hemisphere had labile metabolites that were similar to those measured in control animals. Ipsilateral neocortex bordering the focus, and thus constituting the \\\"penumbra,\\\" showed mild to moderate ischemic changes. In the \\\"focus\\\" (lateral caudoputamen plus the overlying neocortex), deterioration of energy state was rapid and relatively extensive (ATP content 20-40% of control). After 5 min of occlusion, no further deterioration of metabolic parameters was observed. Substrate levels were markedly reduced, and lactate content rose to approximately 10 mM kg-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\",\n          \"BACKGROUND: Soluble forms of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) have recently been identified in serum samples from atopic patients, but their clinical significance in the treatment of allergic diseases remains to be established.OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical roles of serum sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 during immunotherapy for perennial allergic rhinitis.DESIGN: Our study included 30 nonatopic volunteers and 60 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis due to Dermatophagoides farinae. The 60 patients had been treated for variable periods (7.3+/-3.0 years [mean+/-SD]) with immunotherapy using a standardized D. farinae antigen. Serum samples were collected from each patient before and after immunotherapy to determine sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 with sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.RESULTS: Serum levels of sICAM-1 in the patients before immunotherapy were higher than those in the nonatopic volunteers (P<.001). The levels of sICAM-1 in the patients' serum samples were decreased significantly after immunotherapy (P<.001), and the percentage of the decrease in the sICAM-1 levels was significantly correlated with the duration of immunotherapy (P=.04) and with the percentage of the decrease in symptom scores (P<.001). The levels of sVCAM-1 in the serum samples from the patients with severe symptoms were significantly higher before immunotherapy than those in the nonatopic volunteers (P=.002) and were significantly decreased after immunotherapy (P=.05). However, the percentage of the decrease in the sVCAM-1 levels was not correlated with the duration of immunotherapy (P=.89) or with the percentage of the decrease in symptom scores (P=.89).CONCLUSION: Decrease in serum sICAM-1 levels during immunotherapy is probably involved in the working mechanisms of immunotherapy, but modulation of serum sVCAM-1 levels is not likely related to the clinical effect of immunotherapy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"meshMajor\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
